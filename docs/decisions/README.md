Read in order. The requirements set what matters, the options pick the shape, and each ADR records one decision with what it costs. ADRs aren't edited to look smarter afterwards; a changed decision gets a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

| Document | What it settles |
|:---|:---|
| [**📋 requirements.md**](requirements.md) | All 16 features ranked. Browser, terminal, sidebar and extensions are Phase 1 musts; the harness is Phase 2; the IDE pane and feeds are Phase 3. |
| [**🏗️ architecture-options.md**](architecture-options.md) | Electron shell vs. a BrowserOS fork vs. VS Code as the shell. Electron wins on cost; its weak spot is MV3 extensions. |
| [**🧱 adr-001-electron-shell.md**](adr-001-electron-shell.md) | The runtime, the GPL-3.0 extension library, and the spike. MV3 extension workers crashed until the 2026-10-20 update, which traced it to the `browser` namespace; what still doesn't work is listed there. |
| [**🔗 adr-002-hub-over-http.md**](adr-002-hub-over-http.md) | Files and bookmarks come from Project Hub's API, called from the main process so Hub's same-origin guard needs no change. |
| [**💻 adr-003-terminal-in-main.md**](adr-003-terminal-in-main.md) | node-pty with the bundled ConPTY, a fixed shell, and the renderer only picks a folder. Why the app calls `app.exit(0)` on quit, and (2026-10-20) why `terminal_run` types only into a fresh terminal opened for it. |
