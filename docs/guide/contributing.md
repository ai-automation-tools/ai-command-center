## The checks

```powershell
npm run lint     # node --check on every JS file
npm test         # unit tests over src/shared/
npm run smoke    # the real app on a throwaway profile; add -- --live for the Hub and Cronsole checks
npm run demo     # builds the browser demo into _site/
```

- Branch from `main` and open a pull request against `main`.
- Keep `npm run lint` and `npm test` green. CI runs both, plus `npm audit`, on every push.
- Run `npm run smoke` when you touch the main process, the preload or the shell UI. What it checks is in [tests/](../../tests/README.md).
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) has the standards, the security invariants and the list of things this project won't do.

## The roadmap routine

- A scheduled routine opens PRs twice a week from `roadmap/auto-<date>` branches, one [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) item at a time.
- An org-wide sweep reviews and merges them.
- The routine never changes dependencies. When a PR you merge changes `package.json`, quit the app and run `npm install` yourself.
